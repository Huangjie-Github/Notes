①Which is your favorite way of learning ? ②Would you rather be left to discover things for yourself or have others guide you ?③ In this unit we look at some very different types of learning , giving you the chance to consider which you prefer .④ We start with the contrast some draw between a Western emphasis on discovery learning to encourage creativity and the traditional Chinese preference for a more guided approach to developing skills .⑤ We finish by looking at how children can be taught the value of money by putting more control over it into their own hands , leaving them to learn from experience rather than through persuasion , through practice than preaching .
